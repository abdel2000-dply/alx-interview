# 0x09-island_perimeter

## Description
This project contains a function `island_perimeter(grid)` that calculates the perimeter of an island described in a grid.

## Requirements
- `grid` is a list of list of integers:
  - 0 represents water
  - 1 represents land
- Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
- Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
- `grid` is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
- The grid is completely surrounded by water
- There is only one island (or nothing).
- The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
